  <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
  <div id="plotly-div">
    {{ sent_type_effective|safe }}
    <p>
      We expected to see that advertisements with negative sentiments would generally score lower than positive sentiments, especially since
      the large majority of the advertisements have positive sentiments, no matter the topic. But it seems that positive, neutral, and negative 
      sentiment advertisements all largely scored within the 3-5 range.

  <h2>Analysis Methods</h2>
  <h5>Random Forest</h5>
    <p>We use random forest to build a classifer model that uses the video annotations as features to predict
      the effective score (1-5) that an annotator would give the advertisement. This would tell us whether or not
      the topic and sentiment of an advertisement is enough to predict how someone would rate its effectiveness.
    </p>
  <h5>K-Modes Clustering</h5>
    <p>We used K-Modes clustering to show how the clustering of strategies and visuals change with sentiment type.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>t-SNE Visualization</li>
        <p>Preserves local structure of the data</p>
      <li>UMAP Visualization</li>
        <p>Preserves local and global structure of the data</p>
    </ul>
