  <h1>Exploratory Data Analysis</h1>
  <div id="plotly-div"></div>

    <p>The data used by OAI is provided by Pitt Ad Video and Image Dataset. It consists of free-form annotations and multiple-choice selections, raw and cleaned as text and numbers. There is a list of topics and sentiments, and scores for effective, exciting, funny, and language.
    </p>
    <p>There are two datasets: an image dataset of 64,832 image ads and a video dataset of 3,477 ads</p>

    <h3>Inconsistency Data</h3>

      <p>The data between the image and video datasets are vastly different as the image datasets contain free-form annotations like Q+A, symbols, strategies, and slogans (all written as text). While the video dataset contain more of the numeric data like funny, exciting, language and effective scores. Although the video dataset contains one type of annotation data which is the Action/Reason category. </p>

    <h3>Insightful Visualizations</h3>

    <p> We expected to see that advertisements with negative sentiments would generally score lower than positive sentiments, especially since
      the large majority of the advertisements have positive sentiments, no matter the topic. But it seems that positive, neutral, and negative 
      sentiment advertisements all largely scored within the 3-5 range. </p>
